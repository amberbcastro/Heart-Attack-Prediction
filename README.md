# Heart-Attack-Prediction
What are the leading risk factors of a heart attack based on the analyzed dataset?

## Heart Attacks: An Overview of the Causes and Consequences
### Importance
## Dataset: [Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/heart-attack-prediction-dataset)
The analyzed dataset was chosen from kaggle.com due to its extensive list of potential causation variables. Although synthetically-generated by ChatGPT, the dataset mirrors real-world data and was created for others to use in their exploration of various data modeling techniques. The data includes 8763 data points of patient data across 26 variables including demographic and health habit variables.
### Variables
For the purposes of this project, the following variables were analyzed:
| Variable Name   | Description                              | Type     | Default Value |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|
| `Diabetes`| Whether the patient has diabetes | `number` | `1: Yes, 0: No` |
| `Family.History`| Family history of heart-related problem | `number` | `1: Yes, 0: No` |
| `Smoking`| Smoking status of the patient | `number` | `1: Yes, 0: No` |
| `Obesity`| Obesity status of the patient | `number` | `1: Yes, 0: No` |
| `Previous.Heart.Problems`| Previous heart problems of the patient | `number` | `1: Yes, 0: No` |
| `Medication.Use`| Medication usage by the patient | `number` | `1: Yes, 0: No` |
| `Heart Attack Risk`| Presence of heart attack risk | `number` | `1: Yes, 0: No` |

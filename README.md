# Heart-Attack-Prediction
What are the leading risk factors of a heart attack based on the analyzed dataset?

## Heart Attacks: An Overview of the Causes and Consequences
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the leading cause of death for women and men in the United States. The conditions that fall under heart disease account for the causes of heart attacks -- primarily the clogging of arteries. Every 40 seconds, someone in the United States dies of a heart attack. 
### Importance
Because of its great contribution to mortality in the United States, the causes of heart disease -- and more specifically, heart attacks -- are worth studying. Discovering the underlying predictors that put people more at risk of developing heart disease or having a heart attack allows us to minimize their prevalence and thus eliminate their deadliness.

__Figure 1:__ "As plaque builds up in the arteries of a person with heart disease, the inside of the arteries begins to narrow, which lessens or blocks the flow of blood." This restriction of blood flow to the heart is the primary cause of a heart attack.

## Dataset: [Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/heart-attack-prediction-dataset)
The analyzed dataset was chosen from kaggle.com due to its extensive list of potential causation variables. Although synthetically-generated by ChatGPT, the dataset mirrors real-world data and was created for others to use in their exploration of various data modeling techniques. The data includes 8763 data points of patient data across 26 variables including demographic and health habit variables.
### Variables
For the purposes of this project, the following variables were analyzed:
| Variable Name   | Description                              | Type     | Default Value |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|
| `Diabetes`| Whether the patient has diabetes | `number` | `1: Yes, 0: No` |
| `Family.History`| Family history of heart-related problem | `number` | `1: Yes, 0: No` |
| `Smoking`| Smoking status of the patient | `number` | `1: Yes, 0: No` |
| `Obesity`| Obesity status of the patient | `number` | `1: Yes, 0: No` |
| `Previous.Heart.Problems`| Previous heart problems of the patient | `number` | `1: Yes, 0: No` |
| `Medication.Use`| Medication usage by the patient | `number` | `1: Yes, 0: No` |
| `Heart Attack Risk`| Presence of heart attack risk | `number` | `1: Yes, 0: No` |
